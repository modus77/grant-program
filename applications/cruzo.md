### Overview

The first NFT greeting card & crypto gifts multi-chain Web3 platform. Bringing a billion-dollar industry to Blockchain. Our mission is to advance the mass adaptation of NFTs through a revolutionary greeting cards and gifts marketplace

Greetings, gifts and party goods a billion-dollar market requiring millions of on-chain transactions. We need a sustainable blockchain partner with low gas fees to run our platform.

We believe having our project will benefit to VeChain Ecosystem. Digital greetings, gifts, and party goods have a huge commercial potential, especially in terms of on-chain transaction quantity. VeChain is a fast-growing network with huge potential. Being a part of VeChain Ecosystem and having partnership relations with VeChain will boost our development and awareness.

We considering using Multi-task Transaction (MTT) in the case when the user gifts an NFT card + Cryptocurrency in one transaction. We are also interested in realizing Fee Delegation and Transaction Dependency on our platform. All these technologies are very actual for the service we provide to the users.

### Ecosystem Fit
Web2: American Greetings, Hallmark, Moonpig, Evite, Paperlesspost. American Greetings have a very strong position on the market, but they do not provide NFT for their customers.  

Web3: OpenSea, Rarible, Airnfts. OpenSea is a leading marketplace for NFT, but they are for all types of content. 

We are building a niche marketplace for NFT cards, crypto gifts, and party goods for Metaverse. Positioning together with Blockchain technology will give us an undeniable advantage. Greetings cards can be collectable NFTs, gifts can be cypto gifts, digital NFT party goods can be used in Metaverse.
