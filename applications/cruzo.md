## Project Overview 

- Project: CRUZO
- Team Name: Cruzo Team
- Payment Address: 0x0b39AeC55662D8DeD1af14e4E0effF84eE32D65d

### Overview

The first NFT greeting card & crypto gifts multi-chain Web3 platform. Bringing a billion-dollar industry to Blockchain. Our mission is to advance the mass adaptation of NFTs through a revolutionary greeting cards and gifts marketplace

Greetings, gifts and party goods a billion-dollar market requiring millions of on-chain transactions. We need a sustainable blockchain partner with low gas fees to run our platform. 

We believe having our project will benefit to VeChain Ecosystem. Digital greetings, gifts, and party goods have a huge commercial potential, especially in terms of on-chain transaction quantity. VeChain is a fast-growing network with huge potential. Being a part of VeChain Ecosystem and having partnership relations with VeChain will boost our development and awareness.

We have an idea to release gifting options by secret link generation. Users can share this link with NFT with the recipient. Your Controllable Transaction Lifecycle could be an option in case the secret link is expired. We also considering using Multi-task Transaction (MTT) in the case when the user gifts an NFT card + Cryptocurrency in one transaction. We are also interested in realizing Fee Delegation and Transaction Dependency on our platform. All these technologies are very actual for the service we provide to the users.

- API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

### Ecosystem Fit
Web2: American Greetings, Hallmark, Moonpig, Evite, Paperlesspost. American Greetings have a very strong position on the market, but they do not provide NFT for their customers.  

Web3: OpenSea, Rarible, Airnfts. OpenSea is a leading marketplace for NFT, but they are for all types of content. 

We are building a niche marketplace for NFT cards, crypto gifts, and party goods for Metaverse. Positioning together with Blockchain technology will give us an undeniable advantage. Greetings cards can be collectable NFTs, gifts can be cypto gifts, digital NFT party goods can be used in Metaverse.

## Development Roadmap 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an <b>example roadmap</b>. For each milestone:

- Please indicate the milestone duration, workload in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) and cost. 
- Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of details must be high enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
- Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
- Please commit to providing dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
